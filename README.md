# VirtualTourist
Tour the world from the comfort of your couch! You can drop pins on a map and pull up Flickr images associated with that location in a collection view. You can also refresh the collection view, which downloads a new set of photos from Flickr. Locations and images are persisted using Core Data. 

## Approach
Virtual Tourist follows the MVC pattern. The model contains networking code for the Flickr API, as well as the NSManagedObject subclasses for Core Data.

### Key Technology and Frameworks Utilized

* Swift 3
* MVC
* UIKit
* MapKit
* CoreData
* RESTful networked APIs
